# linux_management_scripts

This script sets up a cron job that runs the command ord wallet inscriptions every 2 hours on an Ubuntu server. It also redirects the output of the command to a file called log.txt in the same folder as the Python script, and writes a timestamp to the log file each time the command is executed.

The cronjob string specifies the schedule for the ord wallet inscriptions command, using the */2 notation to specify a run every 2 hours. The command variable specifies the full command to be executed, including the output redirection to the log file.

The script then writes the cron job to a temporary file, installs the cron job, and creates the log file if it doesn't already exist. Finally, the script opens the log file and appends a timestamp to the file each time the command is executed.

Overall, this script automates the execution of the ord wallet inscriptions command on a regular schedule and logs the output and execution times to a file for later analysis.
